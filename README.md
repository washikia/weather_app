I learnt many new concepts in flutter programming while doing this project.
I learnt about the life cycle of a widget, and how we can perform certain tasks at various points in the prgrams life cycle to achieve intended behaviour.
I learnt how pass data from one page to another, and access an argument from the stateful widget to the state object.
I used routing before to naviagte to other pages, but in this project I sent a data back when poppping a page.
I became more familiar with the use of future and dynamic types and also with the key words async and await for asynchronous programming.
